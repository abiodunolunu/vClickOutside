# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

## A click outside directive for Vue3

- This is a directive to detect when an outside of a element has been clicked and the perform an action when that happens.

- A little tweak was added that makes it just run if the element was previous clicked-in and not just run on any outside click.
